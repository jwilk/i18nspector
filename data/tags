 Note that in some languages,
 the commonly used Plural-Forms expression evaluates to the same value for n=1 and n=21, n=31, and so on.
 Take this Serbian translation for example::
 .
 .  Plural-Forms: nplurals=3; plural=n%10==1 && n%100!=11 ? 0 : n%10>=2 && n%10<=4 && (n%100<10 || n%100>=20) ? 1 : 2;

 .  msgid_plural "%d bytes"
 .  msgstr[0] "%d bajt"
 .  msgstr[1] "%d bajta"
 .  msgstr[2] "%d bajtova"
 .
 Here ``%d`` should not be replaced with the spelled-out form ``jedan``.
 Either ``%d`` should be kept, or the Plural-Forms expression should be amended,
 so that there is a special case for n=1::
 .
 .  Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=n==1 ? 3 : n%10==1 && n%100!=11 ? 0 : n%10>=2 && n%10<=4 && (n%100<10 || n%100>=20) ? 1 : 2
