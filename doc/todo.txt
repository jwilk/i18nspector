Verify that we can recognize all the languages Poedit supports:
https://raw.github.com/vslavik/poedit/master/src/isocodes.cpp

Gather information about languages with principal territory:
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/gettext.git/tree/gettext-tools/src/msginit.c#n505

Complain about incorrect locale codes:
 * al -> sq
 * cn -> zh
 * cz -> cs
 * dk -> da
 * en_UK -> en_GB
 * gr -> el
 * in -> id
 * no -> nb
 * sh_BA -> bs_BA
 * sh_HR -> hr_HR
 * sh_RS -> sr_RS
 * sr_CS -> sr
 * sr_YU -> sr

Validate ``Project-Id-Version``.

Validate ``Report-Msgid-Bugs-To``.

Validate ``Last-Translator``.

Guess language from ``Language-Team``.

Validate ``Plural-Forms``.

Check for unknown headers that don't begin with ``X-``.

Check for encodings that couldn't support all the language's characters (e.g.
ISO-8859-1 for Polish).

Figure out what to do with encodings supported by iconv but not by Python.
