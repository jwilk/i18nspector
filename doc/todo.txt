Use Language() objects in the checker.

Complain about incorrect locale codes:
 * al -> sq
 * cn -> zh
 * cz -> cs
 * dk -> da
 * en_UK -> en_GB
 * gr -> el
 * in -> id
 * no -> nb
 * sh_BA -> bs_BA
 * sh_HR -> hr_HR
 * sh_RS -> sr_RS
 * sr_CS -> sr
 * sr_YU -> sr
 * uk_UK -> uk_UA

Validate ``Project-Id-Version``.

Validate ``Report-Msgid-Bugs-To``.

Validate ``Last-Translator``.

Guess language from ``Language-Team``.

Validate ``Plural-Forms``.

Check for encodings that couldn't support all the language's characters (e.g.
ISO-8859-1 for Polish).

Figure out what to do with encodings supported by iconv but not by Python.

Fix support for ``X-Poedit-Language: (Afan) Oromo``.

Fix support for ``X-Poedit-Language: Serbian (Latin)``.

Do not follow symlinks by default. This should facilitate running g-i on
(semi-)unstrusted input.

Document the security model.

Allow running g-i on Debian packages (both .deb and .dsc).
